China's widening COVID-19 curbs threaten global supply chain paralysis (Photo: Reuters)                                              Reuters         Apr 14, 2022,   Updated Apr 14, 2022, 10:42 AM IST                                                                                                                                                              China's race to stop the spread of COVID-19 is clogging highways and ports, stranding workers and shutting countless factories - disruptions that are rippling through global supply chains for goods ranging from electric vehicles to iPhones.  While some factory owners try to tough it out through ""closed loop"" management that keeps workers isolated inside, some said that is becoming harder to sustain given the extent of local COVID-19 curbs aimed at heading off the Omicron variant, complicating efforts to procure materials or ship products.  Foxconn Interconnect Technology, a unit of Taiwan-based Foxconn that makes data transmission equipment and connectors, has kept a plant open in Kunshan, which borders Shanghai, in a closed loop but is only able to run at 60% of capacity, a person familiar with the matter said.  Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.  On Wednesday, more than 30 Taiwan companies, many making electronics parts, said that COVID-19 measures in eastern China had led them to suspend production until at least next week.  A day earlier, German auto parts giant Bosch said it suspended output at sites in Shanghai and Changchun, while putting two other plants under ""closed-loop"" operation. Also on Tuesday, Taiwan's Pegatron Corp, which assembles Apple Inc iPhones, halted operations in Shanghai and Kunshan.  Sven Agten, Asia Pacific CEO of Rheinzink, a German maker of zinc construction materials, said logistical challenges make a closed-loop unworkable at his Shanghai warehouse and manufacturing facilities, and expects to have zero sales during April and possibly May.  ""We need somebody in the warehouse and the manufacturing facility to do the work, and we need a truck and a driver. These are the two key components, and both are impossible,"" he told Reuters.  China's zero-tolerance approach to COVID-19, despite low case numbers and even as the rest of the world tries to live with the coronavirus, is proving unwieldy given the extreme infectiousness of the less-deadly Omicron variant.  The zeal to cut-off virus transmission chains means localised curbs extend far beyond virus hotspots Shanghai and Jilin province in the northeast. An April 7 study by Gavekal Dragonomics found that 87 of China's 100 largest cities by GDP have imposed some form of quarantine curbs.  On Saturday, electric vehicle maker Nio said it had to suspend production at its Hefei factory - even though there were no local-level curbs - because suppliers from other areas had stopped work.  TRUCKERS' BLUES  Truck transport has been especially hard hit, causing long queues and delays and driving up prices. The normal rate to book a truck from Shandong province to Shanghai had more than quadrupled from 7,000 yuan ($1,100) to 30,000 yuan, said an executive at a trucking firm who declined to be identified.  ""It has become extremely difficult for our company to find available trucks near Shanghai in the past two weeks as many truck drivers were either stuck on the highways or locked down in the cities,"" he said, adding that he was subcontracting orders - at a loss - to keep goods moving.  The city of Xuzhou, a logistics hub, on April 8 began requiring truck drivers to produce negative PCR test results taken within 48 hours to take more tests upon arrival. They cannot exit their trucks.  Some drivers have become stuck on highways after visiting areas like Shanghai, which meant their smartphone health codes were automatically invalidated. Last week, state media reported on a truck driver who lived in his truck for seven days after traveling to Shanghai.  CLOGGED PORTS, GLOBAL IMPACT  Foreign business groups have been especially vocal about their concerns, with the European Chamber of Commerce in China sending a letter to the government last week notining that about half of German firms in the country were experiencing supply chain problems.  China has tried to cushion the impact of the curbs by keeping ports and aiports running and encouraging closed-loop manufacturing.  But the number of container vessels waiting off Shanghai – the world’s busiest container port – and nearby Zhoushan has more than doubled since the start of April to 118, nearly three times the number a year ago, Refinitiv data showed. Danish shipper Maersk oMonday recommended to clients that they divert from congested Shanghai port to other Chinese destinations.  Economists have cut growth forecasts for China on the back of such disruptions, with Beijing's official growth target of around 5.5% this year seen as increasingly difficult to reach.  ING last week downgraded its GDP forecast for China to 4.6% from 4.8% previously. On Wednesday its chief economist for China, Iris Pang, warned that China's COVID crisis could impact growth rates around the world.  ""A problem in China could be a problem for the global economy,"" she said.  Chen Xin, who runs a family-owned embroidery and garment painting factory in Guangdong province, said that since late March he has been unable able to ship roughly 70-80% of orders because customers can't receive them.  ""The current situation is, the impact of the policy is greater than the epidemic,"" he said.

Home World Nepal: COVID-19 vaccination rate declines as local elections draw closer  World   Nepal: COVID-19 vaccination rate declines as local elections draw closer   ANI   14 April, 2022 02:30 pm IST    ./block         Facebook    Twitter    Linkedin    Email    WhatsApp       Representative Image Text Size: A-  A+      Kathmandu [Nepal], April 14 (ANI): As the date for local elections is inching closer, cases of COVID-19 vaccination have declined in Nepal, local media reported.   Local elections are set to be held on May 13 across the country.   Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said they are planning to launch a drive to administer Covid booster shots but are worried that election activities could hamper the drive, The Kathmandu Post reported.    “We have to launch a drive to increase the uptake of booster shots and are planning to do so, but we fear that the upcoming elections and pre-election activities could hinder our programme,” said Dr Samir Kumar Adhikari, joint spokesperson for the Health Ministry, according to The Kathmandu Post.   It further reported that with the decline in COVID-19 cases in recent months, the uptake of the coronavirus vaccine has declined significantly. Of late, more people appear reluctant to take Covid booster shots.   Also, health authorities throughout the country have currently halted the COVID-19 vaccination drive to focus on the typhoid vaccination drive, which started last Friday.   “New hybrid Covid variants, which are either recombination of Delta and Omicron or a new mutation of Omicron, have been dubbed as highly infectious than the previous variants have been detected in many countries,” said Dr Rajeev Shrestha of the Dhulikhel Hospital, according to The Kathmandu Post.   Shrestha added, “even if the infection rate of the coronavirus has declined of late throughout the country, the risk has not declined, as new variants could bring a new surge at any time.”   The Election Commission had already asked the health authorities to administer the COVID-19 vaccine to all eligible people before the elections. But the government does not have a detailed record of the vaccinated population, The Kathmandu Post reported.   So far, 19,288,340 people of 66.1 per cent of the total population have been fully immunised with the COVID vaccine.   The Health Ministry says that 2,312,375 people or less than eight per cent of the total population have taken booster shots as of Wednesday.

However, both Chief Minister  Arvind Kejriwal  and Sisodia maintained the government is closely monitoring the situation, and asked people not to panic as there is no rise hospitalisation.  /1050432/www.financialexpress.com/FE_ROS_LIFESTYLE_AS_TEXTWRAP_300x250   “COVID cases have slightly increased but there is no rise in hospitalisation, so we need not worry. There is no need to panic but (we have to) stay alert. We have to learn to live with COVID. We are constantly monitoring the situation,” Sisodia told reporters.  “I have got reports from a few schools in the past few days where parents have informed about their child testing positive. The education department will tomorrow issue guidelines to schools in this regard,” he added.  Delhi on Wednesday reported 299 new COVID-19 cases, a jump of 118 per cent in two days. The positivity rate stood at 2.49 per cent, according to data shared by the city health department.  Reports of infections from schools have sparked concerns weeks after they opened for completely offline classes after a two-year gap due to the pandemic. Kalkaji MLA and senior AAP leader Atishi said, “There are reports of a child and a teacher testing positive for Covid. Other students of the class have been sent home. We are closely tracking the situation.” However, she did not specify the name of the school where cases have been reported.  The fresh infections in the privately-run schools in the national capital have been reported close on the heels of schools in adjoining Noida and Ghaziabad reporting new cases.  “As students across Delhi-NCR turn Covid positive, schools are struggling with protocols. My child’s school has at least 8 kids, 2 staff members positive. But no proper info given to parents, school functioning normally, even those classes with positive cases,” said a parent from a top private school in Vasant Kunj. Schools in Delhi have four days holidays starting Thursday on account of Ambedkar Jayanti, Good Friday followed by a weekend.  The Delhi BJP demanded that in view of the rise in cases, the government should once again make masks mandatory at public places including public transport, schools, colleges and cinema halls.

As the country reported 1,007 daily new coronavirus cases it was also the second day in a row that fresh infections in a 24-hour period were above 1,000. The fresh tally of  COVID-19  cases takes the total confirmed infections to 4,30,39,023. The rise in active COVID-19 cases meanwhile comes amid an uptick in new cases and test positivity rates in at least three States-Delhi, Guajarat and Haryana. Many hospitals and doctors in these states also confirmed that there has been a rise in patients visiting OPDs with COVID-19 symptoms. They however also say that the majority of the patients are mildly symptomatic with fever, cold and cough and do not need hospitalisation.

A vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.         How many types of vaccines are there?     There are broadly four types of vaccine — one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.         What does it take to develop a vaccine of this kind?     Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.

Daily test positivity rates were registered at 10.47 percent for Mizoram, 3.05 percent at Haryana, 2.63 percent at Nagaland and 2.49 percent for Delhi. Also, there are 27 districts in the country which have weekly test positivity rates of over 5 percent and these include 23 districts in Kerala alone. The rising trajectory of the coronavirus is being noticed though there is no confirmation yet, either from the Union health ministry or INSACOG- the government’s COVID-19 genomic surveillance programme- on any new SARS CoV 2 variant that may be causing the higher number of infections.

India, on January 23 had reported the highest ever—over 22 lakh active cases during the peak of the Omicron wave—but the active caseload in the country has been falling since then. Meanwhile, according to the figures shared by the ministry, only one new death was reported in the 24 hours, which is the lowest in 747 days since March 28, 2020. Overall, 5,21,737 people have succumbed to the infectious disease in India as per official numbers.

15.0,China&#39;s Zero-<b>COVID</b> Policy - Take notes of important current affairs here - GKToday,https://www.gktoday.in/topic/chinas-zero-covid-policy,"China’s Zero-COVID Policy - Take notes of important current affairs here - GKToday  ☰     Hello Guest !  Register or Login   |  ₹ 0.00  Home  Current Affairs  Current Affairs Quiz  GK Questions  General Knowledge  E-Books  Printed Books  Download App  Hindi        China’s Zero-COVID Policy Published: April 14, 2022  While other countries across the planet are gradually relaxing their COVID related restrictions and urging their respective citizens that they will have to adjust to the COVID-19 virus, China is following a strict Zero-Covid policy. Contents Overview: Impact of Zero-COVID Policy Relaxation of the policy Overview: The Zero-Covid policy of China involves the use of aggressive measures and policies that are necessary to eliminate and control the COVID-19 virus’s local transmission. The Chinese government remains determined to control COVID-19 outbreaks in the country including the smaller ones. They are prepared to use any harsh measures to get the desired results. This policy of China is affecting public life and the citizens are discontenting. A recent COVID spike led China to implement these measures and placed 193 million people across 23 cities, including Shanghai, in partial or full lockdown. Through the implementation of lockdown measures the control of the local spread was temporarily successful, but the highly transmissible Omicron variant poses a challenge to this policy. Impact of Zero-COVID Policy The measures that are being implemented by China to stop local transmission have been deemed as Draconian by the people as the people of the country are not able to access essential services like food and health care. Several major cities of the country have come to a halt as the residents of the cities are being confined to their respective houses with limited availability of essential resources. Since 2020, China has drastically cut international travel in the country by restricting flights and cancelling visas. This stringent policy of China is also putting strain on the country’s economy. While millions are under lockdown, a lot of the citizens have been forced to relocate to various quarantine camps or metal box houses and have been forced to undergo mass testing. The conditions at these quarantine camps are also not up to the mark with there being a lack of hot water, portable toilets, and privacy. Relaxation of the policy While the country is still implementing these strict measures, the government has shown signs of relaxing other COVID related measures. The criteria for discharging a patient from quarantine have also been relaxed. Earlier, the Chinese government had ruled that asymptomatic, as well as patients with mild symptoms, must also be admitted to the hospital, but now they are proposing to locally isolate such asymptomatic or mild cases.

Photo: PTI/Ravi Choudhary    “The small uptick in COVID-19 cases in some states is to be expected as governments ease more restrictions.”  “The XE recombinant variant is not capable of causing a new wave in India because the BA.2 sub-lineage has already had its run.”  “The odd school closure shouldn’t keep us from opening up schools because the benefits outweigh the risk.”  Anurag Agrawal, former head of the IGIB, made these and other comments in an interview to The Wire Science.    New Delhi : There is currently a small uptick in COVID-19 cases across some of India’s states. The secretary of the Union health ministry  wrote letters  to the chief secretaries of Maharashtra, Kerala, Mizoram, Delhi and Haryana asking them to be on alert and to maintain COVID-appropriate behaviour. Together, these events have  stoked interest  in a potential fourth wave in India.  The Wire Science  spoke with  Anurag Agrawal , dean of biosciences and health research at Ashoka University, Sonepat, and former head of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. The conversation included the chance of a fourth wave in India, reopening schools and theatres, mask mandates and the question of re-reinfections, among others.  The interview has been lightly edited for clarity. The questions are in bold. The editor’s modifications, for clarity, are in square brackets.  What can we make of the rise in cases? Do they signal a potential new wave?  Were we expecting an uptick in cases? Yes. Because all restrictions went away, schools are back to normal, movie theatres and all such places – where the risk of transmission is high – are [now] open. So you were, in any case, going to expect a bump in cases. The question is if the bump is going to become a mountain: only then could there be a fourth wave.  I think it’s too early to read too much into this. Even if parameters like positivity rate and reproductive numbers go up by small proportions, that shouldn’t panic us at this point in time. These parameters don’t function in isolation but with the case trajectory.  Beyond ensuring personal protection, there is nothing much to be done at this point in time.  At what point in time should we see the doubling rate to be a red flag?  It’s hard to say [exactly]. But if the cases double in one week and the doubling time is consistent and clean, then probably one may need to worry. But remember that by doubling, I don’t mean doubling of cases from 10 to 20 cases or 20 to 40. This [amount of] doubling happens easily. But when the bar of doubling is high and the doubling is happening in a week’s time – consistently – then it may be an indicator of exponentially increasing transmission.  Coupled with this, you have to see if vulnerable populations are getting infected. Are you seeing severe cases? And then you start looking at models to understand the future trajectory.  Some states have also reported a minor rise in their respective  reproductive ratios …  If at any time you are getting a steady increase, the reproductive ratio has to be greater than 1. In Delhi, for example, it’s beyond 1, but you have to look at doubling time along with that. If you do that, you don’t see a reason to panic in Delhi also.  We are seeing cases rising but not anything beyond expectations.  Most of the Indian states have done away with mask mandates. Your thoughts?  Mandates are for others’ protection. Encouragement is for one’s own.  At this point in time, I am not inclined to mask mandates. For your personal protection, if you are in a high-risk area, crowded settings or an indoor setting, it’s better to keep the mask on. Therefore, it’s a matter of personal judgement now. Pushing something as a ‘mandate’ that we know is not going to be followed isn’t useful.  Schools opened up but some reported a few cases and then  shut down again . Should they have shut?  Everything is important, including schools. And one has to look at the risk-benefit ratio. Given that more than 70% of children have already got an infection [as a  recent seroprevalence survey  found], they have a certain degree of protection [against severe disease].  Now, children are not ready to stay at home: in other words, they will mingle. So if they can mingle elsewhere, why not in schools?  What would you say to those parents whose children have tested positive?  The risk in children [of severe disease] is very, very low. If children mingle, they will get an infection, but rarely severe disease. Don’t panic at one-off cases, and instead look at the consistent behaviour [of the virus] and evaluate the risks.  Does everybody in India who is older than 18 years need a booster dose?  We know two doses are not good enough. But two doses plus an infection [a.k.a.  hybrid immunity ] gives you decent protection.  Still, if one is 40+ years old in India, one should go for a third dose, because this group has a lot of comorbidities – and at times people are not aware of them. For those who are in the range of 18-40 years, and if they clearly know that they have comorbidities, they may take a third shot, based on their perception of the risks.  Many experts have pitched for a heterologous boosting regimen but the government has stayed with the homologous option.  Heterologous is always good – but look at India’s scenario. More than 80% of the population has taken Covishield for their primary doses. A heterologous vaccine would mean giving this large chunk of the population a Covaxin shot, and the Covaxin production [volume] is small. The government couldn’t have ignored this reality.  But the most important thing is we already have a protein-subunit vaccine. [This is Covovax, manufactured by Serum Institute in India.] It is one of the best candidates for booster doses. I honestly can’t understand the reason why that has yet not become a part of our immunisation programme. Based on all the available data, the protein-subunit vaccine is the best booster candidate.  How much do we need to be worried about the recombinant XE variant, in India?  The XE is a recombination of the BA.1 and the BA.2 sub-lineages [of the omicron variant]. It does not contain any novel mutations as such. India has already been through [outbreaks of] BA.1 and BA.2, more so of the latter. Logically, one does not see a reason for India to worry too much about it. Given time, the virus will evolve further, but currently I [personally] don’t see XE being capable of creating a massive new wave.  We need to be vigilant and that is sufficient.  So the fears of a fourth wave are ill-founded, right?   For me, a wave is a wave if it [strains] the healthcare infrastructure and leads to substantial morbidity and mortality. That I really don’t see [happening at the moment], and therefore the fears are ill-founded.  But the omicron variant caused a third wave without straining the healthcare infrastructure.  At that time also, I maintained that we would get a wave of infections but not a [strain] on our healthcare systems. Reasonable precautions [in the event of a surge] of infections is always a good idea. That’s it.  A recent article in  The Guardian  said reinfections are going to define the future of this pandemic. Your take on this vis-à-vis India?  Reinfections are easy to measure when the gap between [the number of] known infections and the total [number of] infections is small. In the UK, this gap is a small one. But in India that’s not the case, to begin with.  Secondly, seroprevalence surveys that came before the omicron variant said 80% of the population in India had already been infected [by the virus]. The omicron variant infected 30-40% more. So most of those [new] infections would have been reinfections.  What is the difference between reinfections by the same variant and those by different variants?  Reinfections by the same variant happen to the tune of 2-5% [of all infections]. In the case of different variants, the proportion is a bit higher, 20-30%.  But remember that, in India, almost everyone has been infected already. So if there are no reinfections, there can’t be another wave. What you need to worry about in India is not about reinfections but re-reinfections.  With almost everybody having been infected once and a large chunk vaccinated, a new wave can only happen [in India] if a variant is able to break all the barriers: protection granted by previous infection and by the vaccines.
